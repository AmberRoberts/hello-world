trying to remember how to work with git since a year away from coding has taken its toll

I'm pretty stoked that I can play with code, but life got busy and I've been slacking off too much. I need a refresher!

So, we're starting small. The good news is, this is all going way faster than the first time I learned. What's that they say, it's like riding a bike?
